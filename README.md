# 3d-Dynamic Portfolio

### In here I will write the changelog for this project.

#### Date format: (D/MM/YY)

*06/05/2024:* I created the project with vite and installed dependencies, also installed tailwind css, and Imported
the stuff that needed to be imported. *-lordvlads77*

*06/05/2024:* I Finished all the imports and include all the necessary files and setup, and a bit extra to get a backup
in case the project goes kaboom at some point of the development. *-lordvlads77*

*08/06/2024:* Around this time I started implementing the 3d model within the hero section, and it did not worked
it went kaboom, I started debugging I broke everything then I started slowly fixing it.
but then I had to go. So I left it as it, with the idea of commiting to github once the fix was finished,
**BIG MISTAKE** *-lordvlads77*

*13/06/2024:* I decided to do keep working on this, and then since a bit of time passed I forgot that I was halfway
through debugging, so thinking that this was the botched branch with no fix yet, I decided to start from scratch
the implementation of the 3d model in the hero section, so I restored the branch to its starting postion and created
a new branch by the time I remembered that I was halfway through fixing it, it was too late and I had to really start
from scratch. *-lordvlads77*

*16/06/2024:* I continued working on the 3d implementation and it finally worked! it showwws it's aliveeeee!!
the problem was an issue with class naming and therefore wrong serialization. *-lordvlads77*

*PD: I realize now that this is now more
of a dev log and not much a changelog so I may change this in the future*

*19/06/2024:* I added a scrollbar feature so users mobile users now the can scroll down, and added a media query
function so the 3d model of the hero section resizes appropiately when surfing the page on small devices, ie like a
mobile phone or a small tablet, or a phablet though I do not know if those exist anymore
(insert sweat drop emoji here).*-lordvlads77*

*01/08/24:* I started the About Section, with framermotion a h2 and p tag. *-lordvlads77*

*05/08/24:* I finished the "About" Section, with the framer motion, nice Service Cards, a Higher Order Component
and within a Section Wrapper that makes all the current done Sections of the Nice look nice and Center, also there is
some really nice animations done by the framermotion that makes the page look just **AWESOME.** *-lordvlads77*
